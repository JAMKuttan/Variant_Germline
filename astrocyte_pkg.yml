# A summary of the workflow package in plain text
description: |
  This is a workflow package for the BioHPC/BICF RNASeq workflow system.
  It implements a simple RNASeq analysis workflow using TrimGalore, HiSAT,FeatureCounts,
  StringTie and statistical analysis using EdgeR and Ballgown, plus a simple R Shiny
  visualization application.

# DOCUMENTATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A list of documentation file in .md format that should be viewable from the
# web interface. These files are in the 'docs' subdirectory. The first file
# listed will be used as a documentation index and is index.md by convention

# Remember - The workflow file is always named 'workflow/main.f'
#            The workflow must publish all final output into $baseDir

# A list of clueter environment modules that this workflow requires to run.
# Specify versioned module names to ensure reproducability.

workflow_parameters:

  - id: fastqs
    type: files
    required: true
    description: |
      One or more input paired-end FASTQ files from a RNASeq experiment and a design file with the link between the same name and the sample group
      regex: ".*(fastq|fq).gz"
      min: 1
 
 - id: pairs
   type: select
   required: true
   choices:
     - [ 'pe', 'Paired End']
     - [ 'se', 'Single End']
   description: |
     In single-end sequencing, the sequencer reads a fragment from only one end to the other, generating the sequence of base pairs. In paired-end reading it starts at one read, finishes this direction at the specified read length, and then starts another round of reading from the opposite end of the fragment.

 - id: alignment
   type: select
   required: true
   choices:
     - [ 1, 'Aligned Fastq']
     - [ 0, 'Input is GATK Recalibrated/Realigned BAM']

  - id: markdups
    type: select

    choices:
      - [ 'mark', 'Remove Duplicates']
      - [ 'keep', 'Keep All Sequences']
    description: |
      Duplicate reads are defined as originating from the same original fragment of DNA. Duplicates are identified as read pairs having identical 5-prime positions (coordinate and strand) for both reads in a mate pair and optionally, matching unique molecular identifier reads.
      
  - id: design
    type: file
    required: true
    description: |
      A design file listing pairs of sample name and sample group

  - id: capturebed
    type: file
    required: true
    description: |
      A capture bed file is a bed file of the targeting panel or exome capture used for the sequencing, this file is used to assess capture efficiency and to limit variants to capture region
